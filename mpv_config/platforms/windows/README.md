# Windows Platform Configuration

This directory contains Windows-specific configurations for the mpv video player.

## Future Implementation

In future versions, this directory will contain:

1. Windows-specific mpv configuration overrides
2. Windows-specific scripts and utilities
3. Windows-specific binary files (if needed)

## Notes

- Windows implementation will require testing with the appropriate mpv binary
- May require additional configuration for proper font rendering
- Will need to handle Windows-specific paths and file system operations
