# Linux Platform Configuration

This directory contains Linux-specific configurations for the mpv video player.

## Future Implementation

In future versions, this directory will contain:

1. Linux-specific mpv configuration overrides
2. Linux-specific scripts and utilities
3. Linux-specific binary files (if needed)

## Notes

- Linux implementation will require testing with various distributions
- May need to handle different package managers and installation methods
- Will need to consider Flatpak, Snap, and traditional package installations
- Font rendering may vary across distributions
